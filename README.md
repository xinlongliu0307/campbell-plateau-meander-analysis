# campbell-plateau-meander-analysis

This repository includes all the appendix figures in the manuscript "Characteristics and Trends of the Campbell Plateau Meander in the Southern Ocean: 1993-2020":

The first part includes the tests in meander position identification, which is divided into the relative threshold value tests, sum period value tests, 'Jumps' in the meander's monthly trajectories.

The second part includes the statistical significance tests for the meander's latitude position, width and geostrophic current speed trends, which is divided into the rolling-mean year based trends, the sample autocorrelation functions and their 95% confidence intervals for the meander's monthly position, width and speed trends.
