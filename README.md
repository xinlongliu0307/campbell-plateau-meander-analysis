# campbell-plateau-meander-analysis

This repository includes all the appendix figures in the manuscript "Characteristics and Trends of the Campbell Plateau Meander in the Southern Ocean: 1993-2020":

Appendix A includes the tests in meander position identification, which is divided into:
1. relative threshold value tests,
2. sum period value tests,
3. 'Jumps' in the meander's monthly trajectories.

Appendix B includes the statistical significance tests for the meander's latitude position, width and geostrophic current speed trends, which is divided into:
1. Rolling-mean year based trends,
2. Sample autocorrelation functions and their 95% confidence intervals for the meander's monthly position, width and speed trends.
