This repository includes all the detailed figures in the appendix of the manuscript "Characteristics and Trends of the Campbell Plateau Meander in the Southern Ocean: 1993-2020":

"Tests in Meander Position Identification" includes the main tests conducted during the identification of the meander's position, which is divided into:
1. Relative threshold value tests,
2. Sum period value tests,
3. 'Jumps' in the meander's monthly trajectories.

"Meander Trends Analysis" includes the statistical analysis for the meander's latitude position, width and geostrophic current speed trends based on both the original monthly time series and the smoothed rolling-mean year data, which is divided into:
1. Rolling-mean year based trends of the meander's position, width and speed,
2. Sample autocorrelation functions of the meander's monthly position, width and speed trends,
3. Sample autocorrelation functions and their 95% confidence intervals of the meander's monthly position, width and speed trends.
