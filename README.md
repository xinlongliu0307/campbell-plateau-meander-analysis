## Repository Structure  

### 1. Tests in Meander Position Identification  
This section documents the statistical tests used to evaluate and revise the identification of the meander’s position. It includes:  
- **Sum-period value tests** – quality checks on the temporal consistency of the meander detection.  
- **Trajectory ‘jump’ tests** – identification and handling of discontinuities in the meander’s monthly position.  

### 2. Meander Trends Analysis  
This section presents the statistical analysis of the meander’s characteristics—latitude position, width, and geostrophic current speed—using both raw monthly time series and smoothed rolling-year means. It includes:  
- **Rolling-year mean trends** – long-term changes in meander position, width, and speed.  
- **Sample autocorrelation functions** – assessment of temporal persistence in the monthly records.  
- **Confidence interval testing** – uncertainty analysis of autocorrelation functions at the 95% confidence level.
